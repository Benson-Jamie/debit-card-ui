#Features:
°° The ATM CARD is designed with a responsive userface that flips the card to the other side when clicked. The card was created to help explore creative skills in using gradients, box shadows, and layout techniques to replicate the look and feel of a real-world bank card for use in portfolios, web apps, or design inspiration. 
°° Other images that were used specifically the Visa and the Chip image were directly saved from the browser so no ownership.

#Future considerations
°° Be sure to add javascript and frameworks inorder to make it more responsive and updated.
